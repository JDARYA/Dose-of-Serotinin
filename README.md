There are many critics in the world; food critics, movie critics, psychiatrists. Alas, where are the TikTok connoisseurs? Whomst among us dares to anatomize the originality, the flavor, the immaculateness ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ, the grotesqueness, the controversiality that is TikTok?

Despair no longer, for I shall embark upon this voyage. I will assume the role of TikTok critic. This wesbite shall be dedicated to meticulously scrutinizing Tiky Toks I find on the limited edition app. While there are youtube compilations to be viewed online, they lack profound and qualititative reviews of the Tiky Toks they have compiled. I shall provide said quality reviews for you, the audience, to enjoy as you contemplate the incredible decision that goes into leaving a like.

<h1> The Criteria </h1>

I shall evaluate the TikToks based on the following

; Originality
; Humor
; Logos (if there is any, as some TikToks are made to inform the public about pressing issues)
; Wow Factor or Wholesome Factor (depending on what I feel like)
