There are many critics in the world; food critics, movie critics, psychiatrists. Alas, where are the TikTok connoisseurs? Whomst among us dares to anatomize the originality, the flavor, the immaculateness ༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ, the grotesqueness, the controversiality that is TikTok?

Despair no longer, for I shall embark upon this voyage. I will assume the role of TikTok critic. This wesbite shall be dedicated to meticulously scrutinizing Tiky Toks I find on the limited edition app. While there are youtube compilations to be viewed online, they lack profound and qualititative reviews of the Tiky Toks they have compiled. I shall provide said quality reviews for you, the audience, to enjoy as you contemplate the incredible decision that goes into leaving a like.

There shall be 3 TikToks reviewed today. Why? Idk man, I just felt like it ¯\_(ツ)_/¯ 

<h1> The Criteria </h1>

I shall evaluate the TikToks based on the following ☜(⌒▽⌒)☞

; Originality

; Humor

; Logos (if there is any, as some TikToks are made to inform the public about pressing issues)

; Wow Factor or Wholesome Factor (depending on what I feel like)

<i> Rip :') </i>

- O. 8/10 I've seen plenty of videos where people beat each other up for clout, so this is nothing new. But the way in which they did it was new.
- H. 10/10 Was very much entertaining to play on loop, I thoroughly enjoyed ☜(⌒▽⌒)☞
- L. Literally none
- WF. 11/10 The dude's flip was cool, but would have been enhanced had we been able to witness the display of pure agony and torment on the sliding dude's countenance ٩◔̯◔۶

<i> Kitty and Egg ｡◕‿‿◕｡ </i>

- O. 5/10 This is a TikTok trend, where eggs are given to doggos. Since they switched it up and gave it to a cat, they get some originality pts (~˘▾˘)~
- H. 2/10 I chuckled a little when the cat refused to relinwuish its grasp of the egg
- L. 1/10 They referenced that naimslas recognize the fragility of eggs and treat eggs accordingly
- WHF. 50/10 LOOK AT THE LITTLE BABY HE SO CUTE WITTLE SHNUCKUMS HE PROTECC HE ATTACC BUT MOST IMPROTANTLY he hold egg like he is an egg shacc JBHLSUJBWDHEQWKXYWEXYEYIYBXENWHVJYQW   (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ ✧ﾟ･: *ヽ(◕ヮ◕ヽ)

<i> A Rose Would Smell Just As Sweet By Any Other Name </i>

- 0. 7/10 Felt like something out of a Wattpadd fanfic
- H. 10/10 Cheered me up, especially after the "debate". Comedy was very NOICE. SNL could neverrr and Shakespeare cries knowing his comedic works pale in comparison ｡゜(｀Д´)゜｡
- L. ┬┴┬┴┤(･_├┬┴┬┴ -49999/10 Literally nothing in the video would ever happen. The only reason it's not -50000 is bc both candidates do indeed leave the podium after the debate
- WF. 1829/10 TRULY A BINGEWORTHY NETFLIX SERIES ENCORE ENCORE (ʘᗩʘ')
