## Welcome to Gen Z's art gallery; TikTok

There are plenty of critics in the world; food critics, movie critics, psychiatrists, etc. Alas, there are not enough TikTok critics. Whomst among us will review the tiky toks and provide quality explanations on the user's ingenuity, their originality, their controversiality? Sure, there are an abundant amount of youtube TikTok compilations, but none that offer a sophisticated response to the tiky toks they choose? 

Despair no longer, for I am here. I shall post weekly reviews of these tiky toks and evaluate them for specific characteristics! Enjoy this art gallery :)
### The Videos;

There are three videos this week

Why, might one ask, are there three? I honestly dk maybe next week there shall be 2 or 1 or 8. Let's see ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

The TikToks shall be evaluated on the following (~_^)

; Originality

; Humor
 
; Logos (if there is any, as some TikToks are meant to relate information to the audience)

; Wow Factor or Wholesome Factor

<i> Roach Video </i> 

- O. 5/10 Dancing Roach is common on the internet, so this is not the first I've seen of the video. However, dancing roaches are not commonly seen in real life, which gave it 5 pts. 
- H. 7/10 Was entertaining, liked watching it and had good loop ˙ ͜ʟ˙
- L. 0/10 Self-explanatory
- WF. 3/10 The animation was nice, but not stunning

<i> Kitty and Egg </i>

- O. 6/10 This is a tiktok trend, so it's kinda common. I haven't seen it on my FYP (For You Page) in a while tho, and the trend was initially to be done with dogs, and so it gets a 6 ~(˘▾˘~)
- H. 2/10 I chuckled a little when the cat refused to relinquish its grasp on the egg, but other than that it was far morw wholesome than humorous
- L. 1/10 The user cited the fact that animals recognize eggs to be fragile and will treat them accordingly
- WHF. 9/10 LOOK AT THE BABY SO CUTE JJAKSUQWDEEDBJHBEASBDEBWEKLWIOHIW HE PROTECC HE ATACC BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY he hold ur egg like his paws are an egg schacc 
(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ ✧ﾟ･: *ヽ(◕ヮ◕ヽ)

<i> A Rose by Any Other Name Would Smell Just As Sweet </i>

- O. 7/10 Something from a wattpadd fanfic
- H. 200/10 SNL could neverrrr. Shakespeare cries knowing he could never compete
- L. -4999/10 Literally impossible for anything in that video to have ever occured. Onlly reason it's not -5000 is beacuse at the end, the candidates do have to leave the podium (▀̿Ĺ̯▀̿ ̿)
- WF. 10000/10 WAS AMAZING, INCREDIBLE, SHOWSTOPPING, ENCORE, TRULY A BINGEWORTHY SERIES ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)
